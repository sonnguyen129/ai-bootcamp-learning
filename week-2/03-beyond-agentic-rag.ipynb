At the end, we\\\\u2019ll optionally show how to upload results to the Evidently Platform for easy exploration.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'ll explore two ways to use an LLM as a judge:\\\\n\\\\n- **Reference-based**. Compare new responses against a reference. This is useful for regression testing or whenever you have a \\\\\"ground truth\\\\\" (approved responses) to compare against.\\\\n- **Open-ended**. Evaluate responses based on custom criteria, which helps evaluate new outputs when there\\'s no reference available.\\\\n\\\\nWe will focus on demonstrating **how to create and tune the LLM evaluator**, which you can then apply in different contexts, like regression testing or prompt comparison.\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n**Prefer videos?** We also have an extended code tutorial where we iteratively improve the prompt for LLM judge with a video walkthrough:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP_aaFnXLmY\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n## Tutorial scope\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s what we\\'ll do:\\\\n\\\\n- **Create an evaluation dataset**. Create a toy Q&A dataset.\\\\n- **Create and run an LLM as a judge**. Design an LLM evaluator prompt.\\\\n- **Evaluate the judge**. Compare the LLM judge\\'s evaluations with manual labels.\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'ll start with the reference-based evaluator that determines whether a new response is correct (it\\'s more complex since it requires passing two columns to the prompt). Then, we\\'ll create a simpler judge focused on verbosity.\\\\n\\\\nTo complete the tutorial, you will need:\\\\n\\\\n- Basic Python knowledge.\\\\n- An OpenAI API key to use for the LLM evaluator.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend running this tutorial in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to render rich HTML objects with summary results directly in a notebook cell.\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  Run a sample notebook: [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/evidentlyai/community-examples/blob/main/tutorials/LLM_as_a_judge_tutorial_updated.ipynb) or [open it in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/evidentlyai/community-examples/blob/main/tutorials/LLM_as_a_judge_tutorial_updated.ipynb).\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n## 1.  Installation and Imports\\\\n\\\\nInstall Evidently:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\npip install evidently\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nImport the required modules:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\n\\\\nfrom evidently import Dataset\\\\nfrom evidently import DataDefinition\\\\nfrom evidently import Report\\\\nfrom evidently import BinaryClassification\\\\nfrom evidently.descriptors import *\\\\nfrom evidently.presets import TextEvals, ValueStats, ClassificationPreset\\\\nfrom evidently.metrics import *\\\\n\\\\nfrom evidently.llm.templates import BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPass your OpenAI key as an environment variable:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nimport os\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\\\\"] = \\\\\"YOUR_KEY\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n**Using other evaluator LLMs**. Check the [LLM judge docs](/metrics/customize_llm_judge#change-the-evaluator-llm) to see how you can select a different evaluator LLM. \\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n## 2.  Create the Dataset\\\\n\\\\nFirst, we\\'ll create a toy Q&A dataset with customer support question that includes:\\\\n\\\\n- **Questions**. The inputs sent to the LLM app.\\\\n- **Target responses**. The approved responses you consider accurate.\\\\n- **New responses**. Imitated new responses from the system.\\\\n- **Manual labels with explanation**. Labels that say if response is correct or not.\\\\n\\\\nWhy add the labels? It\\'s a good idea to be the judge yourself before you write a prompt. This helps:\\\\n\\\\n- Formulate better criteria. You discover nuances that help you write a better prompt.\\\\n- Get the \\\\\"ground truth\\\\\". You can use it to evaluate the quality of the LLM judge.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, an LLM judge is a small ML system, and it needs its own evals\\\\\\\\!\\\\n\\\\n**Generate the dataframe**.

Correctness evaluator\\\\n\\\\nNow it\\'s time to set up an LLM judge! We\\'ll start with an evaluator that checks if responses are correct compared to the reference. The goal is to match the quality of our manual labels.\\\\n\\\\n**Configure the evaluator prompt**. We\\'ll use the LLMEval [Descriptor](/docs/library/descriptors) to create a custom binary evaluator. Here\\'s how to define the prompt template for correctness:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\ncorrectness = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\\\n        criteria = \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details, even if worded differently.\\\\n        The ANSWER is incorrect if it contradicts the REFERENCE, adds additional claims, omits or changes details.\\\\n        REFERENCE:\\\\n        =====\\\\n        {target_response}\\\\n        =====\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n        target_category=\\\\\"incorrect\\\\\",\\\\n        non_target_category=\\\\\"correct\\\\\",\\\\n        uncertainty=\\\\\"unknown\\\\\",\\\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\\\n        pre_messages=[(\\\\\"system\\\\\", \\\\\"You are an expert evaluator. You will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE\\\\\")],\\\\n        )\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  The **Binary Classification** template (check [docs](/metrics/customize_llm_judge)) instructs an LLM to classify the input into two classes and add reasoning. You don\\'t need to ask for these details explicitly, or worry about parsing the output structure \\\\u2014 that\\'s built into the template. You only need to add the criteria. You can also use a multi-class template.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, we\\'ve set up the prompt to be strict (\\\\\"all fact and details\\\\\"). You can write it differently. This flexibility is one of the key benefits of creating a custom judge.\\\\n\\\\n**Score your data**. To add this new descriptor to your dataset, run:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\\\n    LLMEval(\\\\\"new_response\\\\\",\\\\n            template=correctness,\\\\n            provider = \\\\\"openai\\\\\",\\\\n            model = \\\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\\\",\\\\n            alias=\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\",\\\\n            additional_columns={\\\\\"target_response\\\\\": \\\\\"target_response\\\\\"}),\\\\n    ])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Preview the results**. You can view the scored dataset in Python. This will show a DataFrame with newly added scores and explanations.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\neval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_judge_scored_data-min.png)\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  **Note**: your explanations will vary since LLMs are non-deterministic.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\nIf you want, you can also add the column that will help you easily sort and find all error where the LLM-judged label is different from the ground truth label.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\\\n    ExactMatch(columns=[\\\\\"label\\\\\", \\\\\"Correctness\\\\\"], alias=\\\\\"Judge_match\\\\\")])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Get a Report.** Summarize the result by generating an Evidently Report.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nreport = Report([\\\\n    TextEvals()\\\\n])\\\\n\\\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\\\nmy_eval\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will render an HTML report in the notebook cell. You can use other [export options](/docs/library/output_formats), like `as_dict()` for a Python dictionary output.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_report-min.png)\\\\n\\\\nSince we already performed exact matching, you can see the crude accuracy of our judge. However, accuracy is not always the best metric. In this case, we might be more interested in recall: we want to make sure that the judge does not miss any \\\\\"incorrect\\\\\" answers .\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Evaluate the LLM Eval quality\\\\n\\\\nThis part is a bit meta: we\\'re going to evaluate the quality of our LLM evaluator itself\\\\\\\\! We can treat it as a simple **binary classification** problem.\\\\n\\\\n**Data definition**. To evaluate the classification quality, we need to map the structure of the dataset accordingly first. The column with the manual label is the \\\\\"target\\\\\", and the LLM-judge response is the \\\\\"prediction\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\ndf=eval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\\\n\\\\ndefinition_2 = DataDefinition(\\\\n    classification=[BinaryClassification(\\\\n        target=\\\\\"label\\\\\",\\\\n        prediction_labels=\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\",\\\\n        pos_label = \\\\\"incorrect\\\\\")],\\\\n    categorical_columns=[\\\\\"label\\\\\", \\\\\"Correctness\\\\\"])\\\\n\\\\nclass_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(\\\\n    pd.DataFrame(df),\\\\n    data_definition=definition_2)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  `Pos_label` refers to the class that is treated as the target (\\\\\"what we want to predict better\\\\\") for metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n**Get a Report**. Let\\'s use a`ClassificationPreset()` that combines several classification metrics:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nreport = Report([\\\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\\\n])\\\\n\\\\nmy_eval = report.run(class_dataset, None)\\\\nmy_eval\\\\n\\\\n# or my_eval.as_dict()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe can now get a well-rounded evaluation and explore the confusion matrix. We have one type of error each: overall the results are pretty good\\\\\\\\! You can also refine the prompt to try to improve them.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_conf_matrix-min.png)\\\\n\\\\n## 5.

You should pass these datasets as **reference** and **current**. Evidently applies several statistical tests and drift detection methods to detect if the distribution has changed significantly. It returns a \\\\\"drift detected\\\\\" or \\\\\"not detected\\\\\" result.\\\\n\\\\nThere is a default logic to choosing the appropriate drift test for each column. It is based on:\\\\n\\\\n* column type: categorical, numerical, text data \\\\n\\\\n* the number of observations in the reference dataset\\\\n\\\\n* the number of unique values in the column (n\\\\\\\\_unique)\\\\n\\\\nOn top of this, you can set a rule to detect dataset-level drift based on the number of columns that are drifted.\\\\n\\\\n## Data requirements\\\\n\\\\n**Two datasets**. You always need to pass two datasets: current (dataset evaluated for drift) and reference (dataset that serves as a benchmark).\\\\n\\\\n**Non-empty columns**. To evaluate data or prediction drift in the dataset, you need to ensure that the columns you test for drift are not empty. If these columns are empty in either reference or current data, Evidently will not calculate distribution drift and will raise an error.\\\\n\\\\n**Empty values.** If some columns contain empty or infinite values (+-np.inf), these values will be filtered out when calculating distribution drift in the corresponding column.\\\\n\\\\n<Note>\\\\n  By default, drift tests do **not** react to changes or increases in the number of empty values.

       "<p>Drift thresholds are predefined limits that indicate when a change in the data distribution signals a potential issue in machine learning (ML) models. These thresholds help in evaluating whether the characteristics of the incoming data (current dataset) differ significantly from those of the reference dataset (historical baseline). They are crucial for maintaining model performance and validity over time.</p>\n",
       "<h3>How to Use Drift Thresholds?</h3>\n",
       "<p>You can use drift thresholds in the context of data drift detection by configuring them in your ML monitoring framework. Here’s how you can effectively apply drift thresholds:</p>\n",
       "<h4>1. <strong>Define Your Datasets</strong></h4>\n",
       "<p>You always need two datasets: a <strong>current</strong> dataset (your incoming data) and a <strong>reference</strong> dataset (historical data).</p>\n",
       "<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Assume current_data and reference_data are your datasets\n",
       "</code></pre>\n",
       "<h4>2. <strong>Set Column Types</strong></h4>\n",
       "<p>Identify the types of data you are working with (numerical, categorical, or text data). You can specify these types to enhance the drift detection accuracy.</p>\n",
       "<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Example of setting column types\n",
       "definition = DataDefinition(\n",
       "    text_columns=[&quot;text_column&quot;],\n",
       "    categorical_columns=[&quot;category_column&quot;],\n",
       "    numerical_columns=[&quot;numeric_column&quot;]\n",
       ")\n",
       "</code></pre>\n",
       "<h4>3. <strong>Choose Drift Detection Methods</strong></h4>\n",
       "<p>Select one or more statistical methods for detecting drift. Common methods include:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Population Stability Index (PSI)</li>\n",
       "<li>Kullback-Leibler Divergence (K-L divergence)</li>\n",
       "<li>Jensen-Shannon distance</li>\n",
       "<li>Wasserstein distance</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>You can choose the method based on the data type and the distribution you expect.</p>\n",
       "<h4>4. <strong>Set Drift Thresholds</strong></h4>\n",
       "<p>Define the thresholds for drift detection based on your business requirements. This could involve setting a minimum percentage of the dataset that should exhibit drift before actions are taken.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>If more than 50% of features drift, consider retraining the model.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<h4>5. <strong>Implement Custom Methods</strong></h4>\n",
       "<p>If necessary, implement a custom drift detection method using Python functions. This allows for greater flexibility beyond built-in methods.</p>\n",
       "<h4>6. <strong>Evaluate and Monitor</strong></h4>\n",
       "<p>After configuring your drift detection settings, regularly evaluate your datasets to see if drift occurs above the set thresholds.</p>\n",
       "<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Feasible code snippet for monitoring drift\n",
       "report = Report([DataDriftPreset(columns=[&quot;feature1&quot;, &quot;feature2&quot;])])\n",
       "my_eval = report.run(current_data, reference_data)\n",
       "</code></pre>\n",
       "<h4>7. <strong>Set Alerts and Retraining Triggers</strong></h4>\n",
       "<p>Based on the evaluation results, set up alerts or triggers for retraining the model if drift is detected beyond the established thresholds.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Example Code Snippet</h3>\n",
       "<p>Here’s a simplified example to illustrate the steps of using drift thresholds within an Evidently framework:</p>\n",
