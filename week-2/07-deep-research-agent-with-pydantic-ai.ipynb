Um I I won't name the clients but\\n5:34 uh I worked for uh two years to detect\\n5:38 some laundry money and uh that was\\n5:42 laundry money.\\n5:43 Yeah.\\n5:44 Laundrying money laundering. Okay.\\n5:46 Yes. Oh yes. Sorry. I know it's\\n5:50 but uh yeah and it was very interesting\\n5:52 because I had to think as a person that\\n5:56 can do money laundering and um so I I\\n6:00 have the\\n6:02 like they say okay I have this data what\\n6:04 can I do and I was uh working on two\\n6:08 years past data so I had to build in\\n6:12 team not just me uh a model a system to\\n6:17 to detect\\n6:18 yeah strange behavior let's say\\n6:23 so how can uh you think as a money\\n6:26 launderer\\n6:28 uh but first there is some patterns that\\n6:32 are famous like I don't know you are uh\\n6:35 you do some sport with pets and you say\\n6:39 okay I think it's a tennis match for\\n6:41 example Nadal Federer and you say okay\\n6:44 Nadal is will win and you also bet that\\n6:48 Feder will win. So at in the end you\\n6:51 will have um spend some money on both.\\n6:54 So of course you will lose money but the\\n6:57 aim is not to uh for someone who want to\\n7:00 do money laundry. He doesn't want to\\n7:02 earn money but to lose the less\\n7:04 possible.\\n7:05 Mhm. Okay. That's a nice strategy.\\n7:08 Yeah. And what was interesting is that I\\n7:11 I started uh to frame the project and I\\n7:15 see it until the end uh the deployment\\n7:19 the deployment part. Yes.\\n7:23 Okay. Yeah, that's all quite interesting\\n7:25 and I want to ask more but that's not\\n7:28 the main topic today, right? So the main\\n7:30 topic today is what you started one year\\n7:31 ago as you said uh it's indie hacking.\\n7:35 So maybe can you tell us what indie\\n7:38 hacking actually is?\\n7:39 Uh hunting is uh when you are building\\n7:43 projects. I I'm not sure if if this is\\n7:46 the exact definition but uh it's to\\n7:49 build project and to monetize them. Um\\n7:54 so without any funding like when you\\n7:57 what was famous before because I think\\n8:00 this is a new trend. Um what was famous\\n8:04 before is you have a project you pitch\\n8:06 deck you do a pitch deck and you are\\n8:09 trying to find investors uh to invest\\n8:12 invest fund in your in your company but\\n8:16 I won't I don't do this I build uh with\\n8:21 another friend we are free actually but\\n8:24 two of us build it and the other one\\n8:27 help us with administrative\\n8:29 and legal and Um and yes we build this\\n8:34 at our on our free time. So\\n8:39 it's we don't have any pressure. We\\n8:41 don't uh we launch when we can like we\\n8:45 start we wanted to launch something this\\n8:48 week but it will be delayed but it's\\n8:51 okay. We don't have any pressure nobody\\n8:53 knows about it. So yeah that's uh my\\n8:56 definition. Mhm. So basically during uh\\n8:59 daytime you work at IBM as a manager,\\n9:02 data science manager, but after work\\n9:05 after I don't k\",\n",

Yeah.\\n11:01 Sometimes that the body works in a funny\\n11:03 way. it's compensating and then probably\\n11:06 there was some injury that I had like I\\n11:07 don't know 20 years ago and they saw it\\n11:10 on the MRI that is supposed to cause\\n11:12 some pain but it wasn't cuz the body\\n11:16 just learned how to live with it. Yeah,\\n11:18 I I think that could be it. But I'm not\\n11:21 a medical professional so I have no\\n11:22 idea. Uh but you learned a few things\\n11:26 about MRI, right? Yes, about MRI but\\n11:29 also a lot about the medical market and\\n11:31 especially in Germany. Um I think the\\n11:34 main problem for startups is it's like a\\n11:37 cap market. It's basically kept\\n11:39 financially by um how much money people\\n11:43 pay into the system and that's the money\\n11:45 that is available. So if you make some\\n11:47 money, you take it away from someone\\n11:49 else in that market and it's not a\\n11:51 win-win situation because someone else\\n11:54 is have is going to have to lose in\\n11:56 order for you to make money which is not\\n11:59 kind of what you want in a startup. If\\n12:02 if it's like fun and successful,\\n12:05 doesn't it always work like that? So\\n12:07 there is only well in the ideal world\\n12:10 there's a finite uh finite amount of\\n12:12 money assuming that governments are not\\n12:15 printing money, right? So you're always\\n12:17 competing for for money. So if somebody\\n12:20 spends money on your product that they\\n12:22 cannot spend it on somebody else.\\n12:25 Yeah, to some extent I think that's\\n12:27 true. But you still at least it's my\\n12:29 belief you still like governments are\\n12:31 printing money. So that's one thing and\\n12:34 and the other thing is we learned that\\n12:35 from co times right? Yes. And the other\\n12:38 thing is that um like even though\\n12:41 there's there might be a finite amount\\n12:42 of money it can still move around. So if\\n12:45 you spend it on something they can spend\\n12:47 it on something else and it might come\\n12:49 back to you. And so there's some some\\n12:52 kind of win-win that's possible. And\\n12:54 sure, someone is is always going to lose\\n12:58 in some way, but the less obvious it is\\n13:02 or the less um\\n13:05 the less scary it is for your direct\\n13:07 competitors, for example, or for other\\n13:08 players in the market, the more willing\\n13:11 they are to help you um because they're\\n13:13 not seeing themselves being challenged\\n13:14 even though they might be in like\\n13:17 future.\\n13:20 What kind of stuff did you build uh at\\n13:22 the startup?\\n13:24 what kind of what things you build? So\\n13:26 you you said you learned a lot of things\\n13:28 about data engineering economics uh um\\n13:32 talking to customers and I was wondering\\n13:35 what did you actually need to do for the\\n13:38 startup when it comes to for example\\n13:40 data engineering you probably had to\\n13:42 have some sort of platform right\\n13:45 um yes but also to just start small um\\n13:48 so in a startup\",\n",
