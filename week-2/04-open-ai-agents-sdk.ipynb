It\\'s a production-ready upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main). The Agents SDK has a very small set of primitives:\\n\\n*   **Agents**, which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools\\n*   **Handoffs**, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks\\n*   **Guardrails**, which enable validation of agent inputs and outputs\\n*   **Sessions**, which automatically maintains conversation history across agent runs\\n\\nIn combination with Python, these primitives are powerful enough to express complex relationships between tools and agents, and allow you to build real-world applications without a steep learning curve. In addition, the SDK comes with built-in **tracing** that lets you visualize and debug your agentic flows, as well as evaluate them and even fine-tune models for your application.\\n\\nWhy use the Agents SDK\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe SDK has two driving design principles:\\n\\n1.   Enough features to be worth using, but few enough primitives to make it quick to learn.\\n2.   Works great out of the box, but you can customize exactly what happens.\\n\\nHere are the main features of the SDK:\\n\\n*   Agent loop: Built-in agent loop that handles calling tools, sending results to the LLM, and looping until the LLM is done.\\n*   Python-first: Use built-in language features to orchestrate and chain agents, rather than needing to learn new abstractions.\\n*   Handoffs: A powerful feature to coordinate and delegate between multiple agents.\\n*   Guardrails: Run input validations and checks in parallel to your agents, breaking early if the checks fail.\\n*   Sessions: Automatic conversation history management across agent runs, eliminating manual state handling.\\n*   Function tools: Turn any Python function into a tool, with automatic schema generation and Pydantic-powered validation.\\n*   Tracing: Built-in tracing that lets you visualize, debug and monitor your workflows, as well as use the OpenAI suite of evaluation, fine-tuning and distillation tools.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\n```\\npip install openai-agents\\n```\\n\\nHello world example\\n-------------------\\n\\n```\\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\\n\\nagent = Agent(name=\"Assistant\", instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant\")\\n\\nresult = Runner.run_sync(agent, \"Write a haiku about recursion in programming.\")\\nprint(result.final_output)\\n\\n# Code within the code,\\n# Functions calling themselves,\\n# Infinite loop\\'s dance.\\n```\\n\\n(_If running this, ensure you set the `OPENAI\\\\_API\\\\_KEY` environment variable_)\\n\\n```\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\\n```\\n', 'type': 'function_call_output'}, output='Title: OpenAI Agents SDK\\n\\nURL Source: https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python\\n\\nPublished Time: Fri, 17 Oct 2025 21:50:28 GMT\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\nOpenAI Agents SDK\\n\\n===============\\n- [x] -

It\\'s a production-ready upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main). The Agents SDK has a very small set of primitives:\\n\\n*   **Agents**, which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools\\n*   **Handoffs**, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks\\n*   **Guardrails**, which enable validation of agent inputs and outputs\\n*   **Sessions**, which automatically maintains conversation history across agent runs\\n\\nIn combination with Python, these primitives are powerful enough to express complex relationships between tools and agents, and allow you to build real-world applications without a steep learning curve. In addition, the SDK comes with built-in **tracing** that lets you visualize and debug your agentic flows, as well as evaluate them and even fine-tune models for your application.\\n\\nWhy use the Agents SDK\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe SDK has two driving design principles:\\n\\n1.   Enough features to be worth using, but few enough primitives to make it quick to learn.\\n2.   Works great out of the box, but you can customize exactly what happens.\\n\\nHere are the main features of the SDK:\\n\\n*   Agent loop: Built-in agent loop that handles calling tools, sending results to the LLM, and looping until the LLM is done.\\n*   Python-first: Use built-in language features to orchestrate and chain agents, rather than needing to learn new abstractions.\\n*   Handoffs: A powerful feature to coordinate and delegate between multiple agents.\\n*   Guardrails: Run input validations and checks in parallel to your agents, breaking early if the checks fail.\\n*   Sessions: Automatic conversation history management across agent runs, eliminating manual state handling.\\n*   Function tools: Turn any Python function into a tool, with automatic schema generation and Pydantic-powered validation.\\n*   Tracing: Built-in tracing that lets you visualize, debug and monitor your workflows, as well as use the OpenAI suite of evaluation, fine-tuning and distillation tools.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\n```\\npip install openai-agents\\n```\\n\\nHello world example\\n-------------------\\n\\n```\\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\\n\\nagent = Agent(name=\"Assistant\", instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant\")\\n\\nresult = Runner.run_sync(agent, \"Write a haiku about recursion in programming.\")\\nprint(result.final_output)\\n\\n# Code within the code,\\n# Functions calling themselves,\\n# Infinite loop\\'s dance.\\n```\\n\\n(_If running this, ensure you set the `OPENAI\\\\_API\\\\_KEY` environment variable_)\\n\\n```\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\\n```\\n', type='tool_call_output_item'), MessageOutputItem(agent=Agent(name='assistant', handoff_description=None, tools=[FunctionTool(name='fetch_url', description='Fetch the Markdown content of a web page using the Jina Reader service.\\n\\nThis function prepends the Jina Reader proxy URL to the provided `url`,\\nsends a GET request with a timeout, and decodes the response as UTF-8 text.', params_json_schema={'properties': {'url': {'description': 'The URL of the page to fetch.', 'title': 'Url', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['url'], 'title': 'fetch_url_args', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, on_invoke_tool=<function function_tool.<locals>._create_function_tool.<locals>._on_invoke_tool at 0x11a4107c0>, strict_json_schema=True, is_enabled=True, tool_input_guardrails=None, tool_output_guardrails=None)], mcp_servers=[], mcp_config={}, instructions=\"\\nYou're a helpful assistant that helps answer user questions.\\n\", prompt=None, handoffs=[], model='gpt-4o-mini', model_settings=ModelSettings(temperature=None, top_p=None, frequency_penalty=None, presence_penalty=None, tool_choice=None, parallel_tool_calls=None, truncation=None, max_tokens=None, reasoning=None, verbosity=None, metadata=None, store=None, include_usage=None, response_include=None, top_logprobs=None, extra_query=None, extra_body=None, extra_headers=None, extra_args=None), input_guardrails=[], output_guardrails=[], output_type=None, hooks=None, tool_use_behavior='run_llm_again', reset_tool_choice=True), raw_item=ResponseOutputMessage(id='msg_064d621974dce1200068f2bae7ee588193ba443730c865f327', content=[ResponseOutputText(annotations=[], text='The page is about the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, which is a framework designed to create AI applications that utilize agentic behavior.

       "The [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions. It's a production-ready upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main). The Agents SDK has a very small set of primitives:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Agents**, which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools\n",
       "*   **Handoffs**, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks\n",
       "*   **Guardrails**, which enable validation of agent inputs and outputs\n",
       "*   **Sessions**, which automatically maintains conversation history across agent runs\n",
       "\n",
       "In combination with Python, these primitives are powerful enough to express complex relationships between tools and agents, and allow you to build real-world applications without a steep learning curve. In addition, the SDK comes with built-in **tracing** that lets you visualize and debug your agentic flows, as well as evaluate them and even fine-tune models for your application.\n",
       "\n",
       "Why use the Agents SDK\n",
       "----------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "The SDK has two driving design principles:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.   Enough features to be worth using, but few enough primitives to make it quick to learn.\n",
       "2.   Works great out of the box, but you can customize exactly what happens.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are the main features of the SDK:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Agent loop: Built-in agent loop that handles calling tools, sending results to the LLM, and looping until the LLM is done.\n",
       "*   Python-first: Use built-in language features to orchestrate and chain agents, rather than needing to learn new abstractions.\n",
       "*   Handoffs: A powerful feature to coordinate and delegate between multiple agents.\n",
       "*   Guardrails: Run input validations and checks in parallel to your agents, breaking early if the checks fail.\n",
       "*   Sessions: Automatic conversation history management across agent runs, eliminating manual state handling.\n",
       "*   Function tools: Turn any Python function into a tool, with automatic schema generation and Pydantic-powered validation.\n",
       "*   Tracing: Built-in tracing that lets you visualize, debug and monitor your workflows, as well as use the OpenAI suite of evaluation, fine-tuning and distillation tools.\n",

       "8:40 that's a really good idea.\n",

       "13:23 the stack. Uh some companies they do use\n",

       "13:31 self-driving where there is like\n",

       "13:36 if you see some of the Tesla systems,\n",

       "14:07 mistakes. Um well but for me it was kind\n",
       "14:10 of fun to watch. So the ride was more\n",
       "14:12 entertaining than a usual I don't know\n",
       "14:15 um Toyota right cuz I could look at the\n",
       "14:20 at the screen.\n",
       "14:22 >> Um so this thing works with a camera\n",
       "14:24 right\n",

       "14:43 quickly repeat the question for me?\n",
       "14:45 >> Yeah. Yeah. Uh so I was uh talking about\n",
       "14:47 uh these Tesla cars, right? And in Tesla\n",
       "14:50 you there's a screen that shows that\n",
       "14:54 detects people, cars, bikes or whatnot.\n",
       "14:57 Yeah.\n",
       "14:59 >> Do you know how this thing works? Like\n",
       "15:02 does it use just video cameras?\n",
       "15:05 >> Yeah.\n",
       "15:07 >> Uh that's like the USB of Tesla systems\n",
       "15:10 that you know they uh because LAR is\n",
       "15:12 expensive or at least the good quality\n",
       "15:14 ones and uh they want to be like really\n",
       "15:17 scalable. They rely on just cameras. But\n",
       "15:20 it's not just one camera. There's like\n",
       "15:23 uh you know cameras all around the car.\n",
       "15:25 So you get a view from all around like a\n",
       "15:28 360 view of the system and uh you kind\n",
       "15:31 of like run your models on top of it\n",
       "15:33 that can make use of these different\n",
       "15:35 views of the world and see basically all\n",
       "15:38 around the car. So basically the the the\n",
       "15:41 car has a much better holistic view of\n",
       "15:44 the world than a person like a p person\n",
       "15:47 driving the car. Yeah.\n",
       "15:49 >> Yeah. Cuz we cannot have cameras uh on\n",
       "15:51 our back right on our sides.\n",
       "15:54 >> Yep. That's yeah.\n",
       "15:56 >> So yeah, I think that's the goal with\n",
       "15:58 self-driving is to make like driving\n",
       "16:00 safer once it accomplishes that level\n",
       "16:04 of, you know, the the AI reaches that\n",
       "16:06 level. Yeah.\n",
       "16:07 >> Mhm. But what is this screen for? Like\n",
       "16:10 this screen is for self-driving, right?\n",
       "16:12 But in these cases when I took a taxi,\n",
       "16:14 it was Uber or some other ride hailing\n",
       "16:18 service and they were actually driving.\n",
       "16:22 The drivers were driving, not the car.\n",
       "16:24 So what's the point of this thing?\n",
       "16:27 >> I think it's more about like at this\n",
       "16:29 point uh so there's two purposes like\n",
       "16:31 you know in like long drives or if the\n",
       "16:33 stop traffic is like stop and go you can\n",
       "16:36 just put it in the autopilot mode and\n",
       "16:37 you don't need to like be constantly on\n",
       "16:40 the wheel and constantly like super\n",
       "16:42 alert and then the car tricks you. Like\n",
       "16:44 I remember 2 years ago I took a trip to\n",
       "16:47 like Vegas. It was like a 13-hour drive\n",
       "16:50 one way and then 13 hours back and I was\n",
       "16:52 the only person driving and like the car\n",
       "16:55 aided me all the way. Like it drove 95%\n",
       "16:57 of the time and I was like just there\n",
       "17:00 and it was so much better because you\n",
       "17:02 know I couldn't have made it without\n",
       "17:03 that like 12 hours is too much.\n",
       "17:05 >> So it's like an assistant system and\n",
       "17:09 sometimes like people just drive because\n",
       "17:11 they don't trust it. So it's like okay\n",
       "17:14 better me driving than the car doing\n",
       "17:16 something wrong. So it's also about the\n",
       "17:18 trust factor\n",
       "17:18 >> if there is any statistics about that.\n",
       "17:22 Um there is statistics about like uh\n",
       "17:26 failure. People people are saying that\n",
       "17:28 it's better me driving than AI, right?\n",
       "17:30 Or whatever self-driving thing, but like\n",
       "17:33 the question is who actually drives\n",
       "17:35 better\n",
       "17:37 >> because people might be overconfident in\n",
       "17:39 their driving skills, right? But for\n",
       "17:41 some simple cases like you said when you\n",
       "17:44 need to go to Vegas, I don't know what\n",
       "17:47 kind of road is there, but maybe it's\n",
       "17:49 like most of the time it's just\n",
       "17:51 straight, right?\n",
       "17:52 >> Yeah. I I think like uh it's a highway\n",
       "17:55 so it's not like you know there's a lot\n",
       "17:58 of traffic lights and stuff. You just go\n",
       "18:00 straight and you go along the route and\n",
       "18:02 it's like uh there's a there's a patch\n",
       "18:04 which is like just 150 mi straight and\n",
       "18:06 like a normal person would just be so\n",
       "18:08 bored out of their mind if you have to\n",
       "18:10 drive that much.\n",
       "18:13 So, in Berlin, uh it's probably\n",
       "18:15 difficult because there are bikes, uh\n",
       "18:18 the streets are quite narrow, um like\n",
       "18:22 crazy, uh bicycle riders who can jump on\n",
       "18:26 you out of nowhere and um like other\n",
       "18:30 things. I guess that's why they don't\n",
       "18:32 use self.\n",
       "18:34 >> I think Tesla is trying to get into the\n",
       "18:36 European markets though with its\n",
       "18:38 autopilot. Like at least when I was\n",
       "18:40 trying to like when I was there I was\n",
       "18:42 working on some European road signs like\n",
       "18:45 speed limit signs. So yeah.\n",
       "18:48 >> Yeah. But also it's regulated, right?\n",
       "18:50 You're right. So maybe they cannot use a\n",
       "18:53 self-driving yet.\n",
       "18:55 >> Not yet. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
       "18:56 >> I see. I see. Makes sense because I am\n",
       "18:59 originally from Russia and I know in\n",
       "19:01 Russia in Moscow some cars already drive\n",
       "19:04 u without drivers. I guess in San\n",
       "19:07 Francisco too, right?\n",
       "19:09 >> Yes. Yes. SF has SF also has way more\n",
       "19:13 which has like no driver at all. So I\n",
       "19:16 guess very people people are more\n",
       "19:18 interesting.\n",
       "19:19 >> So you get something like Uber and then\n",
       "19:22 a car comes and there is no driver,\n",
       "19:24 right?\n",
       "19:25 >> Yes. There's no one there.\n",
       "19:28 >> If you ever visit if you visit SF next\n",
       "19:31 time, like be sure to take away no. It's\n",
       "19:34 it's quite the tourist attraction right\n",
       "19:36 now over here.\n",
       "19:37 >> Okay. Okay. Ah, that's where you work,\n",
       "19:39 right?\n",
       "19:40 >> Yeah. Yeah.\n",
       "19:41 >> Okay. That's why um is there an app\n",
       "19:44 called Whimo, right?\n",
       "19:46 >> Yes, there's an app called Whimo through\n",
       "19:48 which you can hail it and I think in\n",
       "19:49 some cities they've also partnered with\n",
       "19:51 Uber and Lyft so that you can call via\n",
       "19:54 Uber as well.\n",
       "19:57 >> Yeah. How much about your current uh\n",
       "20:00 position can you talk cuz you mentioned\n",
       "20:02 that uh or we at least know that you\n",
       "20:04 work on gesture recognition right so can\n",
       "20:08 you tell us more about that and how much\n",
       "20:10 I don't know but I would be pretty\n",
       "20:12 pretty curious to know\n",
       "20:15 >> yeah I I think I can like give a high\n",
       "20:17 level picture it's basically about\n",
       "20:19 trying to understand uh you know if\n",
       "20:21 there's like a police officer or a\n",
       "20:24 construction worker trying to guide\n",
       "20:25 traffic like uh you know there's like a\n",
       "20:28 big event or\n",
       "20:29 >> so there is a police officer slow down,\n",
       "20:31 right?\n",
       "20:32 >> Yeah. No, like they they tell you to\n",
       "20:35 stop or they tell you to go or they tell\n",
       "20:38 you to like Yeah. So yeah, that's the\n",
       "20:41 humans like slow down when there's a\n",
       "20:42 police officer.\n",
       "20:44 >> That's the human brain. Uh the car tries\n",
       "20:47 to stay in the traffic rules.\n",
       "20:50 uh but uh yeah I basically try to\n",
       "20:52 understand what they want to say and\n",
       "20:54 communicate with the car and like try to\n",
       "20:57 uh you know modify its root or modify\n",
       "21:00 its behavior according to what what\n",
       "21:02 they're communicating.\n",
       "21:04 So\n",
       "21:05 >> I guess in your case in case of my mom\n",
       "21:07 if you say that there is a right hailing\n",
       "21:10 service the car comes without the driver\n",
       "21:13 and then all of a sudden there is an\n",
       "21:15 event like um I don't know Friday or\n",
       "21:19 whatever with a lot of people like what\n",
       "21:22 the car should do right so cuz in\n",
       "21:24 training data I guess it's less common\n",
       "21:26 to have things like that or like a\n",
       "21:29 traffic light uh breaks\n",
       "21:32 >> and there is a police officer are\n",
       "21:34 controlled in the traffic.\n",
       "21:36 >> Yeah, I think all of these cases are\n",
       "21:38 covered like Whimo has been in business\n",
       "21:40 since like I think 15 years I would say\n",
       "21:43 like they've been working on the product\n",
       "21:45 and try to cover many of the cases that\n",
       "21:49 we have. So you know the broken traffic\n",
       "21:51 light uh large crowds of people uh it's\n",
       "21:56 it's pretty pretty good around it. you\n",
       "21:58 know there are sometimes events and game\n",
       "22:00 nights and it actually does really well\n",
       "22:02 over there. So uh and also like you know\n",
       "22:05 during these cases there are these\n",
       "22:07 police officers controlling the traffic\n",
       "22:09 and like directing traffic and my job is\n",
       "22:12 to make the way more better at\n",
       "22:14 understanding\n",
       "22:17 >> how much can you talk about this project\n",
       "22:19 because I wonder how does it actually\n",
       "22:20 work like what kind of tech do you use\n",
       "22:24 it must be something super fast right?\n",
       "22:26 Uh\n",
       "22:27 >> yeah,\n",
       "22:28 >> so I know you you cannot go into into\n",
       "22:30 details. Uh but I guess it should be\n",
       "22:33 something super fast cuz like you need\n",
       "22:35 to make this decision in real life in\n",
       "22:37 real time, right? So something like I\n",
       "22:40 don't know yellow or something. Um yeah\n",
       "22:43 there are like a bunch of in-house\n",
       "22:44 models that use like you know uh cameras\n",
       "22:47 LA data and like all all the sensor\n",
       "22:50 information that we have or we get from\n",
       "22:52 the car and uh it's like uh way more\n",
       "22:56 does not publish its models what it\n",
       "22:59 uses. So uh these are in internal model\n",
       "23:02 that uh you know they are optimized to\n",
       "23:04 run on the car and they optimized to run\n",
       "23:07 really fast. So it's uh it's probably\n",
       "23:10 not the same neural network that was\n",
       "23:12 trained. It was like you know uh we use\n",
       "23:15 various techniques to make it much\n",
       "23:17 faster and run much faster on the car to\n",
       "23:19 like detect in very quick amounts of\n",

       "23:35 Um I I guess there's a bunch of ways to\n",
       "23:37 do it like you know publicly available\n",
       "23:40 ways are like something like you know\n",
       "23:41 you quantize the model.\n",
       "23:43 >> Yeah exactly this is this is the word I\n",
       "23:45 was looking for quantization.\n",
       "23:47 >> Quantization. Yes. So you make it like\n",
       "23:50 you make it smaller you make it faster\n",
       "23:52 with with quantization. So many of\n",
       "23:55 similar techniques but uh there are a\n",
       "23:57 whole bunch of other stuff that we also\n",
       "23:59 do uh internally.\n",
       "24:03 Yeah, I I guess like I I think that's\n",
       "24:05 the extent of it.\n",
       "24:09 >> I was just thinking not to torture you\n",
       "24:11 and put you in a uncomfortable position\n",
       "24:14 by asking more and I was thinking what\n",
       "24:16 should I ask next cuz you also did a few\n",
       "24:18 other interesting things and one of them\n",
       "24:22 which I find quite interesting is uh\n",

       "24:39 to do more projects about this. Uh so I\n",
       "24:42 I joined this organization called OMina\n",
       "24:44 and basically they work they have like\n",
       "24:46 AI for good projects where you have a\n",

       "25:49 wanted to use machine learning models or\n",
       "25:51 AI to do that. So what what what we\n",
       "25:55 thought that okay if we have like\n",
       "25:56 satellite images or we have some\n",
       "25:58 knowledge of where could be like you\n",
       "26:00 know marshy lands or uh where areas\n",
       "26:03 where like you know water stagnates\n",

       "26:12 could just go with their fumigation and\n",
       "26:14 just fumigate those areas and that would\n",
       "26:16 be much more efficient. It would save\n",
       "26:18 like so many manpower, so much cost and\n",
       "26:20 you know for these kind of nonprofits\n",
       "26:22 cost is a very big I guess\n",
       "26:24 consideration. So I guess with this team\n",
       "26:28 we worked in multiple groups. One team\n",
       "26:31 tried to use satellite images to detect\n",
       "26:33 like water bodies, stagnant water\n",

       "26:53 detect those areas and like you know let\n",
       "26:55 them know. So uh I think uh at the end\n",
       "26:59 like we used kind of an ensemble system\n",
       "27:01 that could use satellite images,\n",
       "27:02 topographic information and give you\n",
       "27:04 this data which they later made some\n",

       "27:11 some good very good results that they\n",
       "27:13 achieved with our models uh with this\n",
       "27:15 but yeah it was like a completely\n",
       "27:17 volunteerbased AI for good project.\n",
       "27:20 So you worked at Morgan Stanley and\n",
       "27:22 managed to also contribute to AI for\n",

       "27:33 are not known for um\n",

       "27:40 Yeah, I I think like it's um I was there\n",
       "27:44 for 2 years so I was already pretty\n",
       "27:47 efficient with all the systems and I\n",
       "27:49 knew where everything was. So I uh I was\n",
       "27:54 and I was interested in learning more\n",
       "27:55 because in financial institutions\n",
       "27:57 generally like you know these newer\n",
       "27:59 technologies like ML and all it's not\n",
       "28:02 easily adoptable. So it's it's really\n",
       "28:04 hard to get started a project. So I I I\n",
       "28:08 worked basically on weekends for this\n",
       "28:09 project that I had.\n",
       "28:11 >> Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, like I have\n",
       "28:14 PTSD now like when you talk about\n",
       "28:16 because I worked at a bank too. It was\n",
       "28:18 2012 so it was a while ago and it was so\n",
       "28:21 difficult to get even like a new\n",
       "28:23 database like to use.\n",
       "28:26 >> Mhm.\n",
       "28:26 >> Uh like let alone starting a new project\n",
       "28:29 that involves machine learning. No,\n",
       "28:31 forget about that.\n",
       "28:33 uh and we deploy it even uh once per\n",
       "28:36 month and if we didn't have a chance to\n",
       "28:39 prepare some things for the deployment\n",
       "28:43 uh cuz there is a process like you need\n",
       "28:44 to do some sort of audit I don't know I\n",
       "28:47 don't remember\n",
       "28:48 >> and if you miss this line then you wait\n",
       "28:51 for one month for the next cycle right\n",
       "28:53 and then only then you can see your work\n",
       "28:56 um actually being applied to real data\n",
       "29:00 and that was frustrating right Uh so\n",
       "29:03 well well I guess there are reasons why\n",
       "29:04 there is there are these bureaucratic\n",
       "29:06 processes right cuz like it's money.\n",
       "29:09 Yeah, I I think I 100% like agree and\n",
       "29:12 you know I can resonate with what you're\n",
       "29:14 saying. You know there are these like\n",
       "29:16 big processes that happen before every\n",
       "29:18 release and deployment that you must do\n",
       "29:20 every single time and it after a point\n",
       "29:23 it gets repetitive and it's like even\n",
       "29:25 for like putting the smallest thing in\n",
       "29:28 production you need to go through this\n",
       "29:29 and at some point it gets to you and\n",
       "29:32 you're like I I want to like do\n",
       "29:34 innovation. I want to like make impact.\n",
       "29:36 I don't want to do like get caught in\n",
       "29:38 processes and stuff.\n",
       "29:40 >> So yeah,\n",
       "29:41 >> which makes me wonder now how does it\n",
       "29:43 work with self-driving cars cuz it's\n",
       "29:45 also not a thing you can easily roll\n",
       "29:47 out, right? So first of all, there is\n",
       "29:49 this component that um like you cannot\n",
       "29:53 really afford having bucks there, right?\n",
       "29:55 cuz like if there is a buck and then a\n",
       "29:58 car misbehaves and I don't know hits\n",
       "30:00 traffic light uh and then like\n",
       "30:04 it's good if nobody gets injured but\n",
       "30:06 like what if somebody gets injured and\n",
       "30:08 it's super bad right? uh especially with\n",
       "30:12 um competitiveness like there are so\n",
       "30:14 many there are multiple\n",
       "30:17 um cars who like how to say companies\n",
       "30:20 that work on self-driving of course you\n",
       "30:23 want to be the best one right so I guess\n",
       "30:26 you have to be super careful when you\n",
       "30:28 work on things like that so how do you\n",
       "30:30 go about deployment in this case\n",
       "30:33 >> yeah I I think like there is again a lot\n",
       "30:37 a I would say multi-month process of you\n",
       "30:40 know deploying any I guess news release\n",
       "30:43 or software because like you mentioned\n",
       "30:46 it's a very sensitive and safety\n",
       "30:48 critical domain. So we want to be\n",
       "30:50 absolutely sure that it doesn't like\n",
       "30:52 negatively impact and doesn't have any\n",
       "30:54 bad behavior out in the open or out in\n",
       "30:57 the wild uh in the world. Mhm.\n",
       "30:58 >> So uh yes uh I think there are different\n",
       "31:01 components you know every time you push\n",
       "31:03 a change you do these whole bunch of\n",
       "31:05 evals you uh try to rerun uh from\n",
       "31:09 existing logs you rerun a lot of\n",
       "31:12 different evaluations and then you\n",
       "31:15 combine your changes with all other\n",
       "31:16 changes and then again there like for\n",
       "31:18 many months you have drivers driving in\n",
       "31:22 multiple areas testing out the software\n",
       "31:24 and like after you have accumulated\n",
       "31:27 enough data points joints that okay this\n",
       "31:29 is safe and this is good to go only then\n",
       "31:32 you deploy it. Uh but yeah the joint\n",
       "31:34 evals and you know uh the drivers\n",
       "31:37 actually driving around like we\n",
       "31:38 engineers are not involved so much with\n",
       "31:40 that. So that process has like it has a\n",
       "31:44 very different team and that is very\n",
       "31:45 well managed and they go through it.\n",
       "31:48 >> But even as engineers we\n",
       "31:50 >> Yeah. Yeah. There are there's tons of I\n",
       "31:52 would say there's lot more than\n",
       "31:53 financial company because\n",
       "31:55 >> you know in like in Morgan Stanley I've\n",
       "31:58 seen there's been losses there's been\n",
       "32:00 millions of dollars of losses but that\n",
       "32:01 you can recover but you know this this\n",
       "32:03 is like someone's life or someone's\n",
       "32:05 safety and it's much more important.\n",
       "32:09 >> Yeah that's interesting. Um, which\n",
       "32:12 reminds me of this uh case. Remember a\n",
       "32:14 few years back um there was a bug in\n",
       "32:17 Windows computers and all the airports\n",
       "32:19 had blue screen of death. Uh what was\n",
       "32:22 that? Crowd Strike, right? It was crowd\n",
       "32:24 strike.\n",
       "32:24 >> Yeah, Crowd Strike I think. Yes, Crowd\n",
       "32:27 Strike.\n",
       "32:27 >> Nobody knew about this thing that this\n",
       "32:29 thing existed until like I had no idea\n",
       "32:33 this company ever existed. uh they got\n",
       "32:37 provider\n",
       "32:38 >> lot of they got a lot of publicity out\n",
       "32:40 of that negative one but uh now we know\n",
       "32:44 what it is.\n",
       "32:45 >> Yeah. And uh so the story there was that\n",
       "32:48 they wrote uh something out and then it\n",
       "32:50 broke right.\n",
       "32:52 >> Yes. Yeah. I think the test thing they\n",
       "32:55 they missed some test cases and\n",
       "32:56 something very unexpected happened over\n",
       "32:59 there.\n",
       "32:59 >> Yeah. I don't know what happened though\n",
       "33:01 but it was a talk of the town I would\n",
       "33:03 say. Mhm. Yeah. But I guess what you\n",
       "33:06 work with is kind of similar in a sense\n",
       "33:09 that there is also the hardware\n",
       "33:11 component, right? So in Morgan Stanley,\n",
       "33:14 I don't know about you, but I assume it\n",
       "33:16 was probably just software, right? You\n",
       "33:17 didn't need to,\n",
       "33:18 >> of course, like you run on a computer.\n",
       "33:21 Uh but chances are that um you know, you\n",
       "33:25 don't run native C code. Most likely\n",
       "33:26 it's Java or Python or I don't know\n",
       "33:29 something like that.\n",
       "33:30 >> Yes. Yes.\n",
       "33:30 >> Um but like once you need to use uh\n",
       "33:34 something low level, something native\n",
       "33:36 and you need to be closer to hardware\n",
       "33:39 uh then things can get complicated,\n",
       "33:42 right? And uh in case of self-driving,\n",
       "33:44 you're very very closely connected with\n",
       "33:46 hardware cuz you actually need to I\n",
       "33:48 don't know steer the wheel or\n",
       "33:50 hit the brakes or whatever.\n",
       "33:53 Yeah, I guess uh definitely connected to\n",
       "33:56 hardware but for my role specifically I\n",
       "33:59 mostly work on the software that drives\n",
       "34:01 it and then there are different teams\n",
       "34:03 that work on the hardware aspect like\n",
       "34:06 you know or connection between the\n",
       "34:07 hardware and software where you do this\n",
       "34:09 whole like making the model faster and\n",
       "34:12 stuff\n",
       "34:13 >> but uh yes it like every time you push\n",
       "34:15 any new change there's this whole suite\n",
       "34:18 that needs to run and it's it's it's a\n",
       "34:20 very comprehensive very thorough ES Yes.\n",
       "34:22 Yes.\n",
       "34:24 >> Are you working on any um um side\n",
       "34:27 projects right now?\n",
       "34:29 >> Uh not right now. Uh what I'm doing\n",
       "34:32 right now is the AI guide dog thing that\n",
       "34:35 I was doing. I'm I'm still mentoring a\n",

       "34:41 it's just like in a mentor capacity. Not\n",
       "34:43 like working on anything right now. I\n",
       "34:46 guess right now the work work aspect is\n",
       "34:48 a bit busy at this time of the year. you\n",
       "34:51 know it's before the November like when\n",
       "34:54 everything slows down uh we have a lot\n",
       "34:56 of work in September October months\n",
       "34:59 >> and then in December it's chill\n",
       "35:01 >> yes a bit chill during the holidays here\n",
       "35:05 >> okay\n",
       "35:06 >> I guess it's the same for most companies\n",
       "35:08 I think I had similar experiences in\n",
       "35:12 >> in Europe definitely\n",
       "35:14 >> yeah yeah\n",
       "35:15 >> I don't know about states but\n",
       "35:18 >> yeah I I think side projects are in like\n",
       "35:21 I I some sometimes start something in\n",
       "35:23 December and then it's it's good if I'm\n",
       "35:25 able to complete it otherwise I wait for\n",
       "35:28 the next December to take it off.\n",
       "35:30 >> But uh yes yeah I think mentoring is\n",
       "35:33 easier because you have uh people\n",
       "35:36 actually working on something and who\n",
       "35:38 have more time to work on it and you can\n",
       "35:39 help them in their process.\n",
       "35:41 >> Yeah. Yeah.\n",
       "35:42 >> Uh what I like about mentoring is you\n",
       "35:45 can test ideas without actually spending\n",
       "35:48 a lot of time implementing them.\n",
       "35:50 >> But you know the outcome, you learn the\n",
       "35:52 outcome from the person you mentor. So\n",
       "35:54 you can just say, \"Hey, you can try this\n",
       "35:56 and that.\" And then a few days later\n",
       "35:58 they come and say if it worked or not,\n",
       "36:00 right? And then you kind of you still\n",
       "36:02 learn from this experience too. Like you\n",
       "36:04 not only teach, you also learn. Um and\n",
       "36:07 then you can know okay\n",
       "36:09 this thing for this case uh maybe not is\n",
       "36:12 the best one so we can try something\n",
       "36:15 else then you also um get experience by\n",
       "36:19 mentoring\n",
       "36:20 >> for sure I I think that's how uh it's\n",

       "50:31 in chess too\n",

       "50:36 with chess the rules are fixed like you\n",

       "51:53 organized for self-driving cars?\n",
       "51:56 Yeah, I I guess like uh it it depends on\n",

       "52:00 do. So I work on pedestrians and\n",
       "52:03 gestures. So we have a bunch of like\n",
